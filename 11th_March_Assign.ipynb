    "Both t-tests and z-tests are statistical tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data, particularly when comparing means. However, they have distinct differences, primarily related to the characteristics of the data and the assumptions that need to be met.\n",

    "T-Test:\n",
    "A t-test is used when the sample size is relatively small (typically less than 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown.

You randomly select a group of 20 students, teach them using the new method, and then compare their average test scores to a hypothesized population mean of 75.
